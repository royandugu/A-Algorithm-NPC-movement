So what we just did is add the buttons to our Vbox contanier from the GUI but now we are going to create a new scene and add a button into that scene and then add buttons by adding child to it rather than directly adding from the GUI. So basically hamile euta button euta naya scene mah create garyo ra tyo button ko pressed vanne signal sanga connect vayera baseko script tesma attach garyo. Then aba tyo scene laii hamro main script mah preload garera instantiate garne.

## Ezra Dialog
This is the script that is present to the main scene. Here we instantiated the scene that contained the ChoiceButton and then it also had a script assigned to it. What we did is that we accessed the variable that was present in that script, assigned the variable which is choiceIndex to the size of an array of buttons we just created in Ezra Dialog. In the function AddChoice we just instantiate the scene with the buttons and then we add that scene to our array. It's like when we have multiple choice buttons each button is from the scene. Then we can also access the VBoxContainer and then add that button as the child
